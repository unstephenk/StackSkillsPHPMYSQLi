<h3>University of Texas at Dallas - MemoryMed</h3>
<p>Below was the final presentation for an Android project we completed
as part of our Requirements class. The goal of the app was to solve the
issue of forgetting to take medication or supplements. Although, we
targeted people with memory disabilities, the app could apply to population
as a whole. We created this application using Android Studio.</p>
